Your preliminary review request has been approved.

Note that the URL validation in your add-on is fragile. Don't use a simple indexOf, but check whether the whole URL matches. Otherwise other pages can easily bypass your checks and activate or deactivate the add-on by adding a specific substring to the URL.

E.g. do not do this:
...
(href.indexOf('crocko.com/') != -1 && href.indexOf('.html') == -1 && href.length > 25) ||
...

But this:
var url = new URL(href);
...
(url.host.endsWith('crocko.com') && crocko.pathname.includes('.html') && crocko.href.length > 25)
...

And you can skip the URL parsing step by calling the function with window.location instead of window.location.href.

Thank you.
